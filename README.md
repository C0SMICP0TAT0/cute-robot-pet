# Advanced Hexapod Robot with ROS Integration

This repository hosts the research and development plan for building an advanced hexapod robot enhanced with ROS (Robot Operating System) integration. The project is designed for individuals with a strong mathematical background who are new to electronics and programming, guiding you through a step-by-step learning process from foundational skills to a fully autonomous, interactive robot.

## Overview

The project leverages ROS to simplify complex robotics tasks, enable code reuse, and provide powerful tools for visualization and debugging. By following the structured phases outlined in this plan, you will:
- Learn essential electronics, programming, and Linux operations.
- Master hardware platforms such as the Raspberry Pi and Arduino.
- Develop computer vision, sensor fusion, and autonomous navigation capabilities.
- Implement coordinated movement using Central Pattern Generators (CPG) and advanced gait algorithms.
- Integrate human interaction features like voice recognition and emotional expression.
- Optimize and integrate all subsystems into a cohesive, high-performance robotics platform.

## Features

- **ROS Integration:** Utilize ROS Noetic for standardization, debugging, and system management.
- **Foundational Learning:** Gain hands-on experience with basic electronics, Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and Linux.
- **Vision & Sensing:** Implement computer vision with OpenCV, LiDAR mapping, sensor fusion, and Hailo AI acceleration.
- **Advanced Movement:** Develop CPG-based leg control, explore gait patterns, and utilize ROS control frameworks.
- **Autonomous Capabilities:** Create terrain-adaptive movement, SLAM-based navigation, and obstacle avoidance.
- **Human Interaction:** Integrate voice recognition, text-to-speech, emotional expression, and adaptive behaviors.
- **System Integration:** Optimize power management, performance, and user interfaces with comprehensive testing and documentation.

## R&D Roadmap

The development is organized into six phases, each targeting key components of the hexapod robot.

### Phase 1: Foundation Building (4-5 months)
- **Electronics & Programming Fundamentals:** Learn circuits, basic Python, Linux commands, and breadboarding.
- **Raspberry Pi & Arduino:** Set up the platforms, control GPIOs/servos, and develop initial code examples.
- **ROS Fundamentals:** Install ROS Noetic, create publisher/subscriber nodes, and learn basic ROS tools.
- **Initial Hardware Control:** Implement single servo control with ROS, plan the power system, and design the initial frame (including URDF models for visualization).

### Phase 2: Vision and Sensing (2-3 months)
- **Computer Vision:** Set up the Raspberry Pi Camera, learn OpenCV, and develop basic object detection.
- **Advanced Object Detection:** Experiment with feature detection, tracking, and integrating pre-trained models.
- **Sensor Integration:** Incorporate distance sensors, IMU, and LiDAR for environmental mapping and obstacle detection.
- **ROS Integration:** Create ROS nodes for camera data, object detection, and sensor fusion using standardized message types.

### Phase 3: CPG and Movement Control (3-4 months)
- **CPG Foundations:** Study oscillator models and implement a basic coupled oscillator network.
- **Hexapod Gait Generation:** Map oscillator phases to joint angles, implement multiple gait patterns, and integrate ROS nodes.
- **ROS Control & Communication:** Use ros_control for servo interfacing, establish communication between Raspberry Pi and Arduino (including multi-Arduino setups), and develop leg kinematics using inverse and forward methods.
- **Gripper Development:** Design and test a gripper mechanism integrated with force sensors and ROS messages.

### Phase 4: Autonomous Capabilities (3-4 months)
- **Advanced Movement Control:** Develop terrain adaptation, balance correction, and energy-efficient movement strategies.
- **Navigation System:** Implement SLAM (using gmapping, cartographer), path planning, and global/local planning with ROS packages.
- **Tool Recognition & Manipulation:** Train detection models for tools and develop corresponding grasping and manipulation strategies.
- **Charging System:** Design an autonomous docking and charging mechanism with ROS-based diagnostics.

### Phase 5: Human Interaction (2-3 months)
- **Voice Recognition & Response:** Set up microphone arrays, integrate speech recognition (e.g., pocketsphinx_ros), and implement text-to-speech.
- **Emotional & Behavioral Expression:** Develop movement patterns for emotional states, idle behaviors, and adaptive human interactions using state machines.
- **Personality Development:** Create memory systems and dynamic personality frameworks stored on the ROS parameter server.

### Phase 6: System Integration and Refinement (3-4 months)
- **ROS Ecosystem Optimization:** Organize nodes into packages, create comprehensive launch files, and implement system monitoring (e.g., rosmon, diagnostics).
- **Subsystem Integration:** Ensure seamless communication among all components, manage power, and perform extended testing.
- **Performance & User Experience:** Optimize processing bottlenecks, develop user-friendly interfaces (rqt plugins, web interface via rosbridge), and document all systems thoroughly.
- **Final Testing & Documentation:** Finalize code, perform durability testing, and prepare maintenance guides along with rosdoc documentation.

## Technical Implementation Details

The ROS architecture is designed as a multi-layered system:

- **Hardware Interface Layer:**  
  - Arduino-ROS communication via rosserial  
  - Sensor drivers for camera, IMU, and LiDAR  
  - Hardware abstraction using ros_control

- **Control Layer:**  
  - CPG controller nodes  
  - Leg kinematics and gait generation nodes  
  - Gripper control and high-level movement controllers

- **Perception Layer:**  
  - Camera and LiDAR processing nodes  
  - Sensor fusion and object detection/recognition nodes

- **Planning Layer:**  
  - Navigation and path planning (SLAM, move_base)  
  - Task coordination and behavior planning using smach

- **Interaction Layer:**  
  - Speech recognition/synthesis and user interface nodes  
  - Behavioral and emotional expression nodes

The core message flow is structured as:  
```
Sensors → Perception Nodes → Planning Nodes → Control Nodes → Actuators
```  
with continuous feedback loops for robust control.
